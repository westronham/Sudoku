/*
 * Ideas of what to do next?
 * 1) We should make a 3rd Sudoku array for user input
 * 		That way if we want to check the solution it's easy, we just compare it to our Sudoku solutions
 * 		Every time the user types in a number in a cell in our GUI, it should write to the corresponding cell in the userSudoku 2d array
 * 2) Haven't gotten a generate sudoku algorithm. At the moment I'm thinking maybe we just focus on getting our GUI
 * 		and hints all done and if we have time we can do the generate sudoku algorithm.
 * 		We can make a folder for easy, medium, hard and have a heap of Sudoku txt files that the user can choose from at the start
 * 		A lot of Sudoku apps do this and if they ask us about why we chose to do this we can say it's because we can provide
 * 		updates to the user with more puzzles and also allows us greater control over things such as difficulty of puzzle that a user gets
 * 3) I'm going to read into saving, and also I'm going to try get the Sudoku grid into a Sudoku GUI rather than have it print the numbers like it does

 * The algorithm that actually figures out what number goes where in our Sudoku

 * Firstly this is a recursive algorithm so we have a base case which is if we get to the last coordinate in the grid
 * Otherwise we go through each coordinate
 * 		If the value in the coordinate is not 0 (i.e. a given value), we recurse to the next cell
 * 		Otherwise we want to figure out the value of the cell so we go through every possible value and if it is a valid value
 * 		we put the value in that cell and flag it in the conditional matrices
 * 		Now the backtracking comes into play (it took me ages to wrap my head around this so message me if it confuses you):
 * 			If we recurse forward without encountering any issues, we return all true and we have the right answer
 * 			If the number turns out to be bad we change the value back to 0 and change the conditional matrix back to false and try the next available value
